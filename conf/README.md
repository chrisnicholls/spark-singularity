# Spark Singularity configs
---------------------------

All of the configs are inherited from [spark-in-space configs](https://github.com/heroku/spark-in-space/tree/master/conf)

To override those defaults, copy the needed config file into the `singularity-overrides/` directory and update `bin/compile` to add the override.
